## 🗂️ Archive Information

### What Was Archived

All documents reflecting the old vision (ChatGPT Agent parity, 175+ app integrations, office automation focus) have been moved to `Planning/Archive/`:

**From Documentation/**:
- PROJECT_SUMMARY_v4.md
- MASTER_INTEGRATION_STRATEGY_v4.md

**From Planning/**:
- Roadmap_v4.md (old 32-week roadmap)

**From Documentation/Development/**:
- COMPLETE_PROJECT_SUMMARY.md
- DELIVERY_CHECKLIST.md
- FINAL_DELIVERY_REPORT.md
- IMPLEMENTATION_STATUS.md
- META_AI_FILES_SUMMARY.md
- META_AI_IMPLEMENTATION_PLAN.md
- PHASES_1-2_COMPLETE.md
- PROJECT_COMPLETE.md
- QUICK_STATUS.md
- SESSION_COMPLETION_REPORT.md

### Why Archived?

These documents represented the previous vision focused on:
- ChatGPT Agent parity (office automation)
- 175+ app integrations
- 32-week, 8-phase timeline

The **current vision** (v5.0) focuses on:
- Always-on monitoring (killer feature)
- Cross-device awareness (critical)
- 12 integration modules (focused scope)
- 7-10 week, 10-phase timeline
- Privacy-first architecture
