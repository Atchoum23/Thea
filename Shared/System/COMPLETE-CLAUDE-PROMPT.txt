I need comprehensive help setting up an automatic error detection system for my Swift/SwiftUI Xcode project. I have all the necessary files already created, but need help executing the setup and verifying everything works correctly.

## 📁 Project Information

**Project Name:** Thea
**Project Type:** macOS app (Swift + SwiftUI)
**Project Path:** `/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea`
**Development Directory:** `/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea`

## 🎯 What I'm Trying to Achieve

I want to stop the endless "build → fix 1 error → build → fix 1 error" cycle by implementing automatic error detection that shows ~99% of errors at once. The system should:

1. **Show errors as I type** (live issues in Xcode) - ~80% coverage
2. **Run checks on every build** (SwiftLint + extra checks) - ~95% coverage  
3. **Validate code on every commit** (Git pre-commit hook)
4. **Optionally monitor files continuously** (background watcher) - ~99% coverage
5. **Provide manual full scans** (`make check` command)

## 📂 Files Already Created in My Project

### Documentation (11 files)
- `START-HERE.md` - Ultra quick start guide
- `AUTO-ERROR-DETECTION-COMPLETE-GUIDE.md` - Complete setup guide
- `QUICK-REFERENCE.md` - All commands with full paths

- `Makefile` - Quick command interface

### Configuration Files (3 files)
- `.swiftlint.yml` - SwiftLint rules and configuration
- `.vscode/tasks.json` - VS Code integration
- `xcode-build-phase-snippet.txt` - Created by installer, contains snippet for Xcode

### Scripts Directory (`Scripts/`) - 7 files

- `pre-commit` - ⚡ Runs automatically on every Git commit
- `configure-xcode.sh` - ⚡ Configures Xcode for live issues (one-time)
- `build-with-all-errors.sh` - Manual full error scan
- `error-summary.sh` - Manual quick error statistics
- `watch-and-check.sh` - Optional background file watcher
- `README.md` - Script documentation

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Instructions I Need Help With

### STEP 1: Verify Project Structure

Please verify all files exist and show me the directory structure:

```bash
cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea'

# List documentation files
ls -lh *.md

# List scripts
ls -lh Scripts/

# List configuration
ls -lha | grep -E "(swiftlint|Makefile|\.vscode)"

# Check if it's a git repo
ls -la .git/
```

### STEP 2: Make All Scripts Executable

```bash
cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea'

# Make all shell scripts executable
chmod +x install-automatic-checks.sh
chmod +x setup.sh
chmod +x COPY-PASTE-COMMANDS.sh
chmod +x Scripts/*.sh
chmod +x Scripts/pre-commit

# Verify permissions
ls -la install-automatic-checks.sh
ls -la Scripts/*.sh
```

Expected output: Files should show `-rwxr-xr-x` permissions

### STEP 3: Check Prerequisites

```bash
# Check if Homebrew is installed
which brew

# Check if SwiftLint is installed (may not be yet)
which swiftlint || echo "SwiftLint not installed (will be installed)"

# Check if fswatch is installed (may not be yet)
which fswatch || echo "fswatch not installed (will be installed)"

# Check if tmux is installed (optional)
which tmux || echo "tmux not installed (optional)"

# Check Xcode is installed
xcode-select -p
```

### STEP 4: Run the Automatic Installer

This is the main installation command:

```bash
cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea'
./install-automatic-checks.sh
```

**What this installer does:**
1. Makes all scripts executable
2. Installs SwiftLint via Homebrew
3. Installs fswatch via Homebrew
4. Configures Xcode settings for live issues
5. Installs Git pre-commit hook
6. Creates `xcode-build-phase-snippet.txt`
7. Offers to start background watcher
8. Shows instructions for Xcode Build Phase

**Expected prompts:**
- May ask for password (for Homebrew installations)
- Will ask: "Start background watcher now? (y/n)" - I'll probably say 'n' for now

### STEP 5: Verify Installation

After the installer completes, verify:

```bash
cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea'

# Check SwiftLint installed
swiftlint version

# Check fswatch installed
fswatch --version

# Check git hook installed
ls -la .git/hooks/pre-commit

# Check snippet file created
cat xcode-build-phase-snippet.txt

# Check Xcode settings
defaults read com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowLiveIssues
defaults read com.apple.dt.Xcode IDEBuildOperationMaxNumberOfConcurrentCompileTasks
```

### STEP 6: Copy Xcode Build Phase Snippet

```bash
cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea'
cat xcode-build-phase-snippet.txt | pbcopy
echo "✅ Snippet copied to clipboard!"
```

The snippet should be:
```bash
# Auto Error Detection
if [ -f "${SRCROOT}/Scripts/auto-build-check.sh" ]; then
    "${SRCROOT}/Scripts/auto-build-check.sh"
fi
```

### STEP 7: Xcode Build Phase Instructions

Please provide me clear step-by-step instructions for adding the Build Phase to Xcode:

**What I need to do in Xcode:**
1. Open project: `/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea`
2. Click project "Thea" in Project Navigator
3. Select Target "Thea" (under TARGETS)
4. Click "Build Phases" tab
5. Click "+" button → "New Run Script Phase"
6. Drag the new "Run Script" phase to be **ABOVE** "Compile Sources"
7. Click ▶ to expand it
8. Paste the snippet (⌘+V)
9. Optional: Rename to "Auto Error Detection"
10. Build (⌘+B) to test

**What I should see in build log:**
```
🔍 Running automatic error detection...
Running SwiftLint...
✅ Automatic checks passed
```

### STEP 8: Test All Components

Help me test each component:

```bash
cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea'

# Test Make commands
make help
make check
make summary

# Test git hook
git status
# (Make a small change and try to commit)
git add .
git commit -m "test commit"

# If it works, you'll see:
# "🔍 Running pre-commit checks..."
```

### STEP 9: Start Background Watcher (Optional)

If I want continuous monitoring:

```bash
cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea'
make watch

# Or with tmux for persistent session:
tmux new-session -d -s thea-watcher "cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea' && make watch"
tmux attach -t thea-watcher
# Detach with: Ctrl+B then D
```

## 🐛 Current Issues in My Project

I have these existing issues that should be caught by the error detection:

### ScreenCapture.swift (3 deprecation warnings)
- Line 128: `'CGWindowListCreateImage' was deprecated in macOS 14.0`
- Line 219: `'CGWindowListCreateImage' was deprecated in macOS 14.0`
- Line 285: `'CGWindowListCreateImage' was deprecated in macOS 14.0`

**Status:** Already fixed by adding `@available(macOS, deprecated: 14.0)` attributes to legacy methods

### UserDirectivesView.swift
- Line 106: Editor placeholder `<#String#>`

**Status:** Fixed by replacing with `"All"`

### WellnessViewModel.swift
- Line 47: Unreachable catch block (no errors thrown)

**Status:** Fixed by removing unnecessary do-catch

## ✅ Expected Final State

After your help, I should have:

### Automatic Features
- ✅ **Live Issues in Xcode** - Errors appear as I type
- ✅ **Build Phase** - Runs SwiftLint + checks on every build (⌘+B)
- ✅ **Git Hook** - Validates code on every commit
- ✅ **Parallel Compilation** - Xcode compiles multiple files at once

### Manual Commands Available
- ✅ `make check` - Full error scan of all files
- ✅ `make summary` - Quick error statistics
- ✅ `make watch` - Background file watcher
- ✅ `make lint` - Run SwiftLint only
- ✅ `make help` - Show all commands

### Configuration Files Active
- ✅ `.swiftlint.yml` - Custom linting rules
- ✅ Xcode settings - Live issues enabled, parallel builds
- ✅ Git hooks - Pre-commit validation

## 🔍 Verification Checklist

Please help me verify each of these:

```bash
cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea'

# 1. Scripts are executable
echo "Checking script permissions..."
ls -la Scripts/*.sh | grep rwxr

# 2. Dependencies installed  
echo "Checking dependencies..."
command -v swiftlint && echo "✅ SwiftLint" || echo "❌ SwiftLint missing"
command -v fswatch && echo "✅ fswatch" || echo "❌ fswatch missing"

# 3. Git hook installed
echo "Checking git hook..."
[ -x .git/hooks/pre-commit ] && echo "✅ Pre-commit hook" || echo "❌ Hook missing"

# 4. Snippet file exists
echo "Checking snippet file..."
[ -f xcode-build-phase-snippet.txt ] && echo "✅ Snippet file" || echo "❌ Snippet missing"

# 5. Xcode settings configured
echo "Checking Xcode settings..."
defaults read com.apple.dt.Xcode ShowLiveIssues 2>/dev/null && echo "✅ Live issues enabled" || echo "⚠️ May need restart"

# 6. Make commands work
echo "Checking Makefile..."
make help

# 7. Directory structure
echo "Checking file structure..."
ls -1 *.md | wc -l
ls -1 Scripts/*.sh | wc -l
```

## 🆘 Common Issues & Solutions

If we encounter these problems, here's how to fix them:

### Issue: "Permission denied"
```bash
chmod +x <script-name>
```

### Issue: "Homebrew not found"
```bash
/bin/bash -c "$(curl -fsSL https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Homebrew/install/HEAD/install.sh)"
```
