Help me set up automatic error detection for my Swift/Xcode project.

**Project:** Thea (macOS app)
**Path:** `/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea`

## Setup Already Done

I have these files ready:
- `install-automatic-checks.sh` - Main installer
- `Scripts/` directory with 7 helper scripts
- `.swiftlint.yml` - Configuration
- `Makefile` - Quick commands
- Multiple .md documentation files

## What I Need

Execute these commands and verify each works:

```bash
# 1. Navigate and make executable
cd '/Users/alexis/Documents/IT & Tech/MyApps/Thea'
chmod +x install-automatic-checks.sh Scripts/*.sh Scripts/pre-commit

# 2. Run installer
./install-automatic-checks.sh

# 3. Copy snippet for Xcode
cat xcode-build-phase-snippet.txt | pbcopy

# 4. Verify everything
make help
make check
```

## Xcode Build Phase

The installer will tell me to add a build phase. I need:
- The exact snippet to paste
- Where to paste it (Build Phases → above Compile Sources)
- How to verify it works (build log should show "🔍 Running automatic error detection")

## Expected Result

After setup:
- ✅ Errors appear as I type in Xcode
- ✅ SwiftLint runs on every build
- ✅ Git hook validates commits
- ✅ `make check` shows all errors

## Help Me

1. Execute the setup commands
2. Show me the output
3. Verify components are working
4. Provide the Xcode snippet
5. Test with `make check`

Ready to start!
